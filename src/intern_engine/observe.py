"""The engine's own memory of when companies really posted.

The Drop Radar used to lean entirely on an outside reference dataset (Simplify),
whose file only starts mid-November — so any company that actually drops in
August–October gets crushed to a November date, and the projection is wrong.

This module fixes that at the root: every run, we record the *real* posted date
the engine observed straight from each company's ATS (`posted_at`), keyed by
company and cycle. That record (`data/observed.json`) is authoritative ground
truth, owned by us, dependent on no third-party repo. It only grows, so once we
have watched a full cycle the radar can project from what companies actually did
last year instead of from a backfilled guess.

Structure:
    {
      "updated_at": "2026-07-07T12:00:00Z",
      "companies": {
        "<normalized name>": {
          "name": "NVIDIA",
          "cycles": {
            "Summer 2027": {"first_posted": "2026-09-03", "count": 4},
            "Fall 2026":   {"first_posted": "2026-03-25", "count": 2}

    Keeps, per company and cycle, the EARLIEST posted date we have ever seen and
    a running count of distinct roles. Monotonic: a role closing and being purged
    from the store never erases the date we learned from it.

    Two guards keep the radar honest — a record is recorded only when BOTH hold:

      1. The cycle was STATED (title or verified text), not inferred from a
         posting date. The radar renders observations as "🎯 verified — the
         engine saw the drop itself"; a date-inferred guess would project
         fiction forward a year.
      2. The cycle is one we actually TRACK. Off-cycle tombstones (e.g. a lone
         "Summer 2026" role we dropped) are real but incomplete — we never swept
         that cycle in full, so projecting it forward would invent a cadence the
         company doesn't have. Cross-cycle projection is a next-cycle feature: we
         record this cycle's real drops now, and project them forward once THIS
         cycle becomes "last cycle".
